# 📊 Customer Churn & Revenue Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior and its revenue impact using **Power BI, SQL, and Python**.
The objective is to identify churn drivers, quantify financial loss, and present insights through an interactive dashboard.

The dataset contains **10,000 customer records** with subscription, usage, tenure, and churn information.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Customer churn leads to direct revenue loss and affects long-term growth.
This analysis answers key business questions:

- What is the overall customer churn rate?
- Which subscription plans are most affected?
- How much monthly revenue is lost due to churn?
- How do usage patterns and tenure differ between active and churned customers?

## 💡 Key Insights
- Churned customers have **lower average weekly usage**
- **Shorter tenure** strongly correlates with churn
- Churn rate is similar across plans, but **Standard plan causes highest revenue loss** due to customer volume
- Usage behavior is a stronger churn indicator than pricing

---

## 📊 Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- KPI cards for churn rate and revenue loss
